## comments ------

`rekex-grammar` could be split into even smaller modules; not worth it for now.

Types in `helper` don't require special handling by grammar and parser builders;
  they conform to the spec therefore they are handled transparently.
  For now, put it under rekex-grammar to avoid having too many modules.
  Also, it's possible that in future versions grammar and parser builders
  do optimize for those helper types with special handlings.
